    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The purpose of the website is to raise public awareness about autism and introduce the Autism Partnership Foundation service to those in need. The website adopts the Hierarchical website structure with 1 main page and 4 child pages. The main page shows a clear message about the charity, “Create a better world for people with Autism”. It provides links to corresponding services and ways for making a donation. The “About Autism” page give a brief summary on the symptoms and causes of Autism to educate the public. The “Events” page demonstrates the activities to bridge the connection between general public and people with Autism. The “What We Do” page explain treatment approach and give a summary to different type of services. It also consists of a sharing video from the service user to increase the credibility of the charity. The last page “Support Us” show the methods for people who wish to provide support on promoting wellbeing of people with Autism and their family.</p>
    <br /><br /><br />

    <h2>Inspiration (British Red Cross, British Heart Foundation & Guide to Flexbox article)</h2>
    <p>The design of the website is inspired from the British Red Cross and British Heart Foundation. The British Red Cross provide a clear structure for the readers to search for information. It has a navigation bar on top such as “Get help”, “Get involved”, “Stories” and a footer to provide other relevant information. My website has adopted similar structure that readers can simply navigate to different pages using header and look for other information in the footer. The British Heart Foundation use of color and multimedia tag to create beautiful pages. Specifically, it mainly uses the color of red, white, and black for building the website. My website adopts the color of blue, green, white and black to provide a consistent layout for different pages. In addition, the Heart Foundation has mixed media with text to create a powerful message. The pages in my website have consisted of videos, photos with captions to let readers have better understanding towards the charity. The use of flexbox is inspired from an article “A Complete Guide to Flexbox”. The article provides graphical examples and explanation on building website with the flexbox properties. I can imagine that each part of the web page is similar to a box. These boxes can be stacked vertical or horizontal based on the resolution of the devices. It is more convenient to use compared to Grid and other CSS style.</p>
    <br /><br /><br />

    <h2>Accessibility (Robust, Operable & Perceivable)</h2>
    <p>My website is built according to the principle of accessibility by the W3C organization. The content is robust that the readers can see the information easily. For the people who have difficulty on reading text in small size, they can click the “A” button to switch to a bigger font size. The font size of the paragraph in web pages will be enlarged by few pixels afterwards. Besides, the color contrast between text and background color has a minimum value of 6 to ensure readers can easily distinguish the content. The content is operable that the readers can navigate the interface using keyboard or a single finger. If the reader cannot use a mouse for browsing the content, they can use the “Tab” key on switching the anchor button and controls in video player, or use “Arrow” key to scroll up and down the page. The content is perceivable that the readers can read captions for multimedia. For the pictures in web pages, there are captions next to them for better understanding. Likewise, the videos have consisted of subtitle that people with hearing problem can understand the speech from speaker.</p>
    <br /><br /><br />

    <h2>Usability (Responsive design, Use of multimedia & Website navigation)</h2>
    <p>The website has provided different interface for readers using different devices. The structure of web page will be adjusted according to the size of the screen. When the screen is below a certain value, the width of the multimedia and paragraph will shrink to fit into the device. Also, the navigation bar on header will switch into menu for the mobile users. It allows the readers to have same experience across different platform. The website has used multimedia to create better visual appearance for readers. The webpage will be boring if it only consists of textual information without any other media. The pictures and videos are more interactive and engage the readers to look for more content. The website has a menu on top and a navigation bubble to show the current location. After the readers has enter the website, they can navigate to different pages by clicking the anchor tag on the header. It allows them to navigate to the child pages to search for useful information. In the child pages, it has a navigation bubble on the top left corner showing the name of current pages and button to back to home page.</p>
    <br /><br /><br />
  
    <h2>Learning (Flexbox, Breakpoint, JavaScript)</h2>
    <p>I have studied the teaching materials on the Internet for using flexbox to create website. The flexbox is consisted for properties including display, flex-direction, align-items, justify-content and many others. When I first started using flexbox, I spend times on studying the use of different properties to achieve the desire outcome. It often gets confused with the row and column direction as the main axis will be swapped on different direction. As time goes by, I become more familiar with those properties and handier to use flexbox. The breakpoint allows me to create different style for different device. I am first puzzled with the approach on creating a responsive website. Whether I should be using view width (vw) / view height (vh) to set the size of element or using breakpoint separately. For this reason, I have tried different approach and find out that it will be clearer to have three unique Stylesheet for laptop, tablet and mobile users on a single page. It provides clarity on creating the structure and easier for me to make modification afterwards. The JavaScript allows readers to have interaction with website by switching font size. It will be complex for the script to navigate element by element to change their size. I have searched for the ideas on adjusting font size for the elements in whole page all at once. Later, I get an idea of using “:root” for setting the universal font size and modify them later in JavaScript with document.documentElement. This will be a better approach that other CSS properties can use the value from the variables in root.</p>
    <br /><br /><br />

    <h2>Evaluation I (rich content and clear structure)</h2>
    <p>The website consists of 5 pages and each page has its own role to convey different messages. The home page gives an overall summary about the charity and user can navigate to other pages for information. Each page consists of media and captions to provide a better understanding of the service. For example, the “What We Do” page shows the services for school, family and children that readers can decide whether the services are suitable for them. It also consists of many pictures and videos to get a comprehensive view about the work of charity in different aspects. In addition, the webpages have a clear structure and make use of different colors. After I have finished the website, I think the current version is more modern compared to the website of Autism Partnership Foundation. Their style is similar to the website in 2010s which consists of many textual information and everything is packed together. The readers may find it hard to read the online materials and not interested to stay longer in the website. The current structure let the readers to read from left to right, from top to bottom without the need on jumping into different sections. Besides, the harmony of color creates a pretty visual appearance to grab readers attention to further exploration.</p>
    <br /><br /><br />

    <h2>Evaluation II (more breakpoint, more decoration and better naming system)</h2>
    <p>The website only has 3 breakpoint which are designed for the laptop (1440px), tablet (768px) and mobile (320px). It is not enough since it may have a large gap between in each breakpoint such as desktop users viewing in a laptop view. To illustrate, the difference between tablet (768px) and a normal size of laptop (1024px) is 256px. If the layout of the page is designed for 768px, there will be an extra gap on the left and right side. The scenario will be even worse if readers are using 2K resolution screen. I may add few more breakpoint for creating a better visual experience in another time. The background of pages is static without having much interaction with readers. It is better to add some decoration such as drawing from people with Autism or animations for transition between pages. In the future, I can add some photo frame on background and readers can click to reveal the name of artist. The naming system for the elements in HTML is not consistent on different pages. If I try to pack some elements inside the same div, it maybe called as box, container, column or row. I should create a hierarchy system like boxes are packed inside container and row or column are nested inside boxes. It will be easier to look for the corresponding style and make modification with a clearer structure.</p>
